# Fake-Face_Detection


In the age of the modern world, machine 
learning and computer vision is playing hard, it is 
going to be the future of technological advances. 
One such advancement is going to be facial 
recognition. Facial recognition is crucial since it 
will replace biometric authentication in the future 
for identity cross-verification. But there is a 
problem with facial recognition. The world is 
making its move towards advancement, it is also 
getting on the worst side to alter the advancement. 
Facial recognition can be altered using open-source 
applications. Altering the face is nothing but 
changing the facial features at pixelated level. A lot 
of work is done in this area but most of them 
worked with SVM classifier with models like 
VGG19, RestNet50, Xception, and LBP (Linear 
Binary Pattern). In this paper we propose to
conduct a comparison study of several CNN model
like RESNET50, LBP(local binary patter),VGG-19 
and Xception with KNN classifier to find out the 
better-performing model and their accuracy. The 
result will be the detection and classification of fake 
and real images from the dataset. The used dataset 
is from the "Real and Fake Face identification" 
deepfake dataset from Yonsei University's 
Computational Intelligence Photography Lab and 
the size is 2100 images which are around 418MB.
